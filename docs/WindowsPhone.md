# Developing Windows Phone Applications

Windows Phone application development requires:

* Windows Vista or Windows 7
* Windows Phone 7.1 SDK
* Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 Service Pack 1

Create a new project using the "Windows Phone" template and build it.
The default build of the Mobile project starts a Windows Phone
Emulator and connects the debugger to it, enabling you to see log
messages from WebSharper in the Visual Studio Output console (Debug).

Consider tweaking the mobile project template to customize your
application metadata and enable signing.
