Requirements in WEBSHARPER_HOME:
	- contents of the bin folder (wp_mobile.exe + Ionic.Zip + 3 targets files)
	- IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Mobile.Android.dll (from the project's release directory)
	- IntelliFactory.WebSharper.Mobile.WP7.dll (from the project's release directory)

VS2010 templates:
	- from WebSharperMobileVSTemplate/out (3 templates)
	If installing templates manually, remember to run (as Administrator on Vista/7):
		"C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv" /InstallVSTemplates
		or (if on 64-bit machine)
		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\Common7\IDE\devenv" /InstallVSTemplates
	
Creating apps:
	In additional to the steps above and creating a project via VS, ws_mobile requires app template files. There are apps which contains all the app, except for the site
		(HTML/CSS/JS/images etc.).
	In order to create Android app template:
		go to WebSharperMobileAndroidEmptyApp, modify AndroidManifest.xml, build (using Eclipse or ant). ?This step requires also the Android SDK?
	Android also requires to sign the applications. You can use the ws_mobile auto-signer (requires the JDK to be installed and references in the PATH) or sign manually.
	In order to create WP7 app template:
		go to WebSharperMobileWP7EmptyApp, open in VS, change properties of the project to match your app name and update images, build. This step requires the WP7 SDK.

When creating WP7 apps, ws_mobile will place a filed called "fileListing.txt" in the *.xap file. This file is used by the app, because Silverlight applications usually cannot get a list of
	accompanying files in the *.xap file. The app uses the list because it has to move all the site's files to the isolated storage (so they could be accessed by the web browser). If you modify
	the app, note that you may still use isolated storage without risk that the files will interfere with the site, as long as you don't use the "www" folder in isolated storage (if you really
	have to, change app's source code).
	
Deploying apps to emulator/device:
	Android:
		First you might wish to start an emulator. You should run androidSdk\tool\android.bat . This will open the AVD manager, where you can create an emulator image and start it.
		For deployment of an app to either an emulator or a device, call "androidSdk\platform-tools\adb.exe install -r appName.apk".
	WP7:
		There is a utility called XapDeploy.exe (at C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows Phone\v7.0\Tools\XAP Deployment) which will assist you in deploying.
	
Note for IF devs:
	- It seems like sometimes there are problems with building the Android and WP7 libraries while older versions of them reside in WEBSHARPER_HOME.
		I am not certain when it happens, and whether or not it still happens (noticed it few days ago, maybe it was resolved).
		UPDATE: This was verified. You must remove the library from the WEBSHARPER_HOME before building the new version of the library.
	- When running ws_mobile for a WP7 project, the program creates and deletes fileListing.txt in the html directory.
	
ToBeConsidered:
	- calibrate scale of GetAcceleration. Which scale do we prefer?
	- run emulators on "Run"?
	- optimization
	- currently /index.html is always the default page. Could be changed. Should be changed?
